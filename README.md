# refuge-requests-brazil
### Using Python and Power BI to create a business intelligence dashboard that shows the evolution of refuge requests

In this project, my colleagues and I prepared a dashboard using public datasets that can help the government better manage refuge requests in Brazil. Here we are not trying to create a forecast model, we just analyze the data to visualize the solicitations raised and understand if Brazil is prepared to receive vulnerable people.

Access the [notebook](https://github.com/rogeriojunio/business-intelligence/blob/main/refuge-requests-brazil/refuge-requests-brazil.ipynb) to understand a little about the refugee program and how the data was processed or [click here](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZGE2ZWJkYjEtNDJhNy00MmQ0LTlmZmItYWI2NmFkZjQ4YTg2IiwidCI6IjFhMzI3OTZlLTE2YjctNDM0NS04ZWZiLWE5ZDc0YTJiOGNmNiJ9&pageName=ReportSectionab7da524e7800e5a65c4) to view the panel.
